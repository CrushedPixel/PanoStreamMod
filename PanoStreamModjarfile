Please provide PanoStreamMod jar file

Hello, nice to meet you!
I may not be good at using github. really sorry.

I had a question twitter before.
Can I download PanoStreamMod in jar file format? I want a file of jar of PanoStreamMod, but I am in trouble because I can not find it.

I am planning to shoot 360 Â° images of Minecraft in real time.
I am glad when the jar file corresponding to Minecraft 1.10.2 which was previously distributed becomes available for downloading.
If the jar file corresponding to Minecraft 1.12 becomes downloadable, I am more glad!

I hope this question will reach you! Thank you!
